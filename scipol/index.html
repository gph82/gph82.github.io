<meta name="description" content="Spanish Researchers Abroad and Science Policy
I have had the opportunity contribute as a volunteer and ultimately serve on the board of these two independent peer-led organizations:

CERFA as board president, and of
RAICEX as board secretary.

These are both independent organizations of Spanish researchers abroad, in Germany and around the globe, respectively.


CERFA e.V.


CERFA, by its acronym in Spanish, is the Society of Spanish Researchers in Germany.
It is an independent, non-profit organization that brings together Spanish research professionals in Germany, and supports them at any stage of their career. We organize networking events at the national, international and multilateral manner, providing visibility to our members through seminars, courses, debates, workshops, and symposia.
Additionally, we act as link  between researchers and institutions —in both Spain and in Germany— at personal, professional and the highest institutional levels. Currently, CERFA has approximately 700 members in Germany.
Positions held:

President since 2022
Vice-president 2020-2021
Regional Director for Berlin-Brandenburg since 2015
Co-founding member since 2013
